This is a comma-separated list of 600 of the world's largest cities according to
[citymayors](http://www.citymayors.com/features/largest_cities1.html). They've
been cleaned up and processed to be machine-readable. Most of these cities
resolve cleanly to [geonames](http://geonames.org) as well.

This is useful if you just need a large database of city names without much
extra info. I needed it for [where did I wake up?](http://wdiwu.heroku.com) and
thought it might be generally useful.

It would be nice to go through and add some UTF diacritics and generally clean
up the localization, but kind of overkill for English speakers.
